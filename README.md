# Node.js Microservice Architecture

This repository contains the full code examples for the equally named series of blog posts on the Traveling Coderman Blog.

For each blog post, there is one branch that expresses the state of the application.
The blog posts build on top of each other.
Equally the branches build on top of each other.
Hence, with each branch the application is reaching a more production-ready state.
